# Dev Meetups Manager
The Dev-Meetups-Manager makes it easier to manage meetups. When organizing a meetup, this allows you to create google calendar event, upload files to the google drive, create and delete zoom meetings and zoom chat channels, upload facebook posts, create github repositories. After you can share created meeting resource among the members attending the meetup. With the help of the Dev-Meetups-Manager application, event organizers can easily manage event calendar, online meetings, GitHub repositories for their events, and performing facebook social media campaigns for their events. 

The Dev Meetups Manager application uses the OAuth 2.0 authentication framework to gain access to Google, Zoom, Facebook and GitHub resources through the API.
